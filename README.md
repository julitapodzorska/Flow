# Flow
This is my graduation App for the Python Back End Developer course at Coders Lab.

Flow is ann app build by woman for women. It's a menstrual tracker built with Django framework. Gathers all menstrual
related data and displays it with friendly, graphic interface. It is also forecasting fertile days. In order to use it one
has to register with all basic information such as name, surname, date of last cycle, and average cycle lenght.
App is still in development.
